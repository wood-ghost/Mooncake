# Mooncake

This is a repo created for fun :D

Hope that those who can’t have physical mooncake can have virtual mooncake several years later. (but they can enjoy the pie right now ;D )

# Introduction

- run

  ```bash
  python sentence.py
  ```

  to get a sentence.

- run

  ```bash
  python picture.py
  ```

  to get a picture.

# Reference

Use the [online ascii art generator](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20) to generate sentence and picture.

Inspired by @[volatileAntiEntropy](https://github.com/volatileAntiEntropy)’s saying that he is not able to have mooncake during the Mid-Autumn Festival in um. 

Inspired by @[volatileAntiEntropy](https://github.com/volatileAntiEntropy)’s idea to celebrate his roommate’s birthday by displaying “happy birthday” on Basys3. 

# TODO:

- Make the picture and the sentence display correctly.
- Enable the sentence to move according to the time.
